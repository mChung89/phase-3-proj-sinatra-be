## Cozy Cribs

## The app to help manage and rent properties

-- Users can browse through properties they want to rent.
-- The properties are sorted by climate, so people renting places have one less thing to thing about when they want to get away.
-- Some people want to just get away and can't decide. This app helps by sorting the properties by the weather.
-- Users can either register as a property rentee or a owner of a property
-- Owners can list their properties and users can rent

## Technlogies used
-- Ruby for the backend using Sinatra
-- React.js/Material UI for the frontend
-- For this project we did not use bcypt to encrypt user passwords. We hashed the passwords manually using SHA-256.
-- Uses the Weather API to grab real-time weather data for each location
